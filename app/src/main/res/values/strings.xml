        Sleep, nutrition, stress, and alcohol are all important factors that can impact mental health.
        Getting enough quality sleep is essential for maintaining good mental health, as it allows the brain and body to rest and repair themselves.
        A healthy and balanced diet can support mental health by providing the body and brain with the nutrients they need to function optimally.
        Managing stress effectively is important for maintaining good mental health, as chronic stress can take a toll on emotional well-being.
        Alcohol can also impact mental health.
        While moderate alcohol consumption is generally considered to be safe,
        excessive consumption can have negative effects on mental health and can worsen symptoms of mental health conditions.
